### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Initially I had felt a bit unprepared for styling with CSS specifcially as it related to using flexbox, but ultimately it seems to make more sense to me now

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I definitely would have worked more on the visual appeal of the website

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

### Shout out

I would definitely give a shoutout to Ayomide, he really explained some of my styling preferences to me, particularly CSS flexbox
